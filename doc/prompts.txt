please read all the .md files in the root of this project, then look at which files exist under the ./doc directory (but don't read all of them; only the ones you need), read all the .md files under the ./doc directory, then:
1) delete ./report.txt
2) write a report on any:
   -- disagreements or discrepencies or confusion
   -- unnecessary overlap
   -- more detail than competant professionals would need
   -- gaps in understanding: assuming the developers and testers already know HOW to do their jobs; do they know WHAT to do?
   Write the report into ./report.txt



please read all the .md files in the root of this project, then look at which files exist under the ./doc directory (but don't read all of them; only the ones you need), read all the .md files under the ./doc directory, then:
1) Let's implement the pg_login page, including all the supporting files
2) Run that page's test.py, and fix any issues
2) write ./report.txt which explains any challenges you faced and what updates to the documentation and/or architecture will make this easier for future developers who will re-implement this from scratch



after implementing this pg_* mini-app, do you have any recommendations for the documentation so that a developer in the future who re-implements this will have less trouble with it? Write these recommendations into ./report.txt
