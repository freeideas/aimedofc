Validating with Claude...

============================================================
Claude Validation Result:
VERDICT: PASS

ANALYSIS:
- The page layout perfectly matches the README specification, displaying the header with "Medical Office Assistant" title, "Welcome, Patient" message (as expected for unauthenticated/placeholder state), and a "Login" button in the top-right corner
- All three main navigation cards are properly rendered in the expected order: "Chat with AI", "View Medical Records", and "My Profile", each with appropriate icons and descriptive text matching the README requirements
- The appointment section displays with actual appointment data (January 1, 2000 appointment with Dr. Smith for routine check-up) rather than showing "(none)" placeholder, indicating the API is returning data successfully
- The Recent Activity section shows three chat conversations with timestamps, demonstrating proper rendering of recent chat history as described in the documentation
- The Quick Actions section at the bottom contains the required "Chat with AI Assistant" and "View All Records" buttons, completing all the essential UI elements specified in the README
