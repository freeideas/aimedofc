============================================================
Claude Validation Result:
VERDICT: PASS

ANALYSIS:
• The page layout perfectly matches the README specification with all expected sections present: header with "Medical Office Assistant" title and "Welcome, Patient" text, main navigation cards, Next Appointment section, Recent Activity section, and Quick Actions buttons at the bottom
• All three main navigation cards are displayed correctly ("Chat with AI", "View Medical Records", "My Profile") with appropriate descriptions and icons, exactly as described in the documentation
• The authentication state is properly displayed with a "Login" button in the top right corner, indicating the page is showing placeholder content for unauthenticated users as expected
• The Next Appointment section shows sample data (January 1, 2000 appointment with Dr. Smith for routine check-up) and Recent Activity shows three placeholder chat items with timestamps, which aligns with the README's description of how the page renders before API data is loaded
• The glassmorphic design system is clearly implemented with dark blue frosted glass panels, white text throughout, and purple gradient buttons for primary actions, matching the visual design specifications in the README
