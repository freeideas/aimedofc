============================================================
Claude Validation Result:
VERDICT: PASS

ANALYSIS:
• **Header section matches perfectly**: The page displays "Medical Office Assistant" as the title, "Welcome, Patient" as the default placeholder message, and has a "Login" button in the top-right corner, exactly as specified in the README.

• **Main navigation cards are present and correctly structured**: All three expected cards are visible - "Chat with AI", "View Medical Records", and "My Profile" - each with appropriate descriptive text and icons, matching the README's requirement for always-visible navigation elements.

• **Next Appointment section displays properly**: The section shows "Next Appointment" with placeholder data (January 1, 2000 at 12:00 PM, Dr. Smith, Routine Check-up), demonstrating that the page renders with meaningful placeholder content as intended.

• **Recent Activity section functions as expected**: Shows three recent chat items with timestamps ("Questions about lab results", "Medication review", "Appointment preparation") which aligns with the README's specification for placeholder chat items that get replaced when authenticated.

• **Quick Actions and visual design are correct**: The bottom section contains the expected "Chat with AI Assistant" and "View All Records" buttons, and the overall purple gradient theme matches the described visual design with clean card-based layout.
