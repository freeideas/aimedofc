AI Analysis:
============================================================
• The page displays the correct title "Medical Office Assistant" with the subtitle "Your Personal Medical Assistant" as expected from the README documentation
• The purple/pink gradient medical-themed color scheme matches the documented design requirements and creates a professional, clean appearance
• Two prominent "Get Started" buttons are clearly visible - one in the hero section and another at the bottom ("Get Started Now"), providing the expected navigation to pg_login
• The features section comprehensively describes how AI reads medical records, chat-based preparation, and supported document types (lab results, prescriptions, etc.) as specified in the README
• The page layout is well-structured with clear sections including benefits, features, simple usage steps, and document types, all rendered correctly without errors and appearing to function as intended
