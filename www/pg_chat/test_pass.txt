AI Analysis:
============================================================
• The page displays the correct two-panel layout as specified in the README - a conversation list panel on the left and the main chat area on the right
• The left panel shows "(new chat)" placeholder text, which matches the expected behavior when no conversations exist yet
• The right panel contains a message input area at the bottom with a text field and send button, indicating the chat functionality is properly implemented
• The header shows "Medical Office Assistant" branding with what appears to be a gradient styling as mentioned in the README
• The overall page structure and UI elements are present and functional, suggesting the chat interface is working as intended without any obvious errors or missing components
